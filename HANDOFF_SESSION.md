### üìã **IMMEDIATE TESTING PLAN**

#### **Phase 1: BT50-Only Impact Testing**
**Objective:** Validate BT50 sensor detects impacts with maximum sensitivity

**Setup Requirements:**
1. **Configuration:** BT50-only mode (AMG disabled in config.yaml)
2. **Sensitivity:** Maximum detection threshold (any movement = impact)
3. **Bridge Status:** Service running with real-time logging
4. **Session ID:** Track with unique session identifier

**Test Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Configure BT50-only mode
ssh raspberrypi 'cd ~/projects/steelcity'
# Verify config.yaml has AMG commented out and BT50 sensitivity maxed

# 2. Start bridge service
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/run_bridge.py --config config.yaml

# 3. Monitor real-time logging
tail -f logs/bridge_$(date +%Y%m%d).ndjson

# 4. User shooting sequence:
# - Power on BT50 sensor (wait for "Sensor_connected" event)
# - Fire 5-10 shots at target
# - Each impact should generate "Sensor_HIT" event with timestamp
```

**Expected Output Format:**
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:15:23.456Z", "event_type": "Sensor_connected", "device_category": "Impact Sensor", "device_id": "12E3", "sensor_id": "P1"}
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:16:45.123Z", "event_type": "Sensor_HIT", "device_category": "Impact Sensor", "device_id": "12E3", "sensor_id": "P1", "magnitude": 15.2}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] BT50 connects and maintains stable connection
- [ ] Each shot generates corresponding "Sensor_HIT" event
- [ ] Timestamps show proper chronological sequence
- [ ] No false positives or missed impacts

---

#### **Phase 2: Combined AMG+BT50 Testing**
**Objective:** Validate synchronized timing between timer start and impact detection

**Setup Requirements:**
1. **Configuration:** Enable both AMG and BT50 in config.yaml
2. **Bridge Status:** Both devices connected simultaneously
3. **Timing Analysis:** Correlate T0 signals with impact events

**Test Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Configure combined mode
# Enable both AMG and BT50 sensors in config.yaml

# 2. Start bridge with both devices
python scripts/run_bridge.py --config config.yaml
# Wait for both "Timer_connected" and "Sensor_connected" events

# 3. Execute synchronized test sequence:
# - Press AMG start button (generates Timer_START_BTN)
# - Fire shots during timing window
# - Each shot should generate both AMG timing and BT50 impact

# 4. Monitor for complete event sequence
tail -f logs/bridge_$(date +%Y%m%d).ndjson | grep -E "(Timer_|Sensor_)"
```

**Expected Time Sequence Log:**
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:20:00.000Z", "event_type": "Timer_START_BTN", "device_category": "Smart Timer", "device_id": "DC1A"}
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:20:00.580Z", "event_type": "Shot_detected", "device_category": "Smart Timer", "device_id": "DC1A", "shot_time": 0.58, "split_time": 0.58}
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:20:00.585Z", "event_type": "Sensor_HIT", "device_category": "Impact Sensor", "device_id": "12E3", "sensor_id": "P1", "magnitude": 12.7}
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:20:00.950Z", "event_type": "Shot_detected", "device_category": "Smart Timer", "device_id": "DC1A", "shot_time": 0.95, "split_time": 0.37}
{"timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:20:00.955Z", "event_type": "Sensor_HIT", "device_category": "Impact Sensor", "device_id": "12E3", "sensor_id": "P1", "magnitude": 14.3}
```

**Analysis Requirements:**
- [ ] Correlate AMG shot timing with BT50 impact detection
- [ ] Measure timing offset between timer and impact (typically 5-10ms)
- [ ] Verify shot count matches between both systems
- [ ] Generate timing correlation report
