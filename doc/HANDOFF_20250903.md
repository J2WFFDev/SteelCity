## SteelCity Impact Detection System - Production Integration

### 🎯 **Session Objectives Completed**
Today's work focused on applying proven connection fixes from minimal bridge testing to the production bridge system, preparing for full system validation.

---

## ✅ **Major Accomplishments**

### **1. Production Bridge Integration**
- **Sequential Connection Strategy Applied**: Updated main `bridge.py` to connect AMG first, wait 2s, then BT50 sensors
- **Direct Connection Method Integrated**: Applied proven `BleakClient(mac, device=adapter)` approach from minimal bridge
- **Process Conflict Detection Added**: Pre-flight check warns about competing bridge processes
- **Module Updates**: Both root and `src/steelcity_impact_bridge/` versions updated

### **2. Connection Issues Resolved**
- **"Operation already in progress" errors eliminated** through sequential connections
- **BT50 UUID conflicts resolved** using correct notification UUID
- **Service enumeration bugs fixed** with proper `len(list(client.services))` handling
- **Process cleanup protocols established** for clean testing environment

### **3. Documentation Created**
- **Minimal Bridge Test Documentation**: Complete guide in `doc/Minimal_Bridge_Test.md`
- **Bridge Test Protocol Updated**: Enhanced cleanup procedures in `BRIDGE_TEST.md`
- **Technical Specifications Documented**: Device UUIDs, connection methods, and troubleshooting

## 🚀 **Next Phase: Critical Items to Address**

### **A. Production Bridge Test** ⏳ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Objective**: Validate production system connects to both devices and streams data
**Requirements**:
- Power on AMG Timer "AMG Lab COMM DC1A" (MAC: 60:09:C3:1F:DC:1A)
- Power on BT50 Sensor "WTVB01-BT50" (MAC: F8:FE:92:31:12:E3)
- Run full bridge test to confirm sequential connections work
- Validate real-time data streaming from both devices
- Confirm impact detection processing pipeline functions

**Expected Results**: 
- `Timer_connected` event with device DC1A
- `Sensor_connected` event with BT50 
- Real-time `bt50_impact_analysis` events during motion
- Raw data logging for both AMG and BT50 streams

---

### **B. AMG Shot Data Collection Issue** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**Problem**: AMG timer shot data not being collected and processed properly by bridge
**Symptoms**: 
- Bridge connects to AMG successfully
- No `SHOT_RAW` events appear in logs during shooting sequences
- Missing shot detection and reporting in bridge output

**Investigation Required**:
- Verify AMG timer is sending shot notifications during firing
- Check if `AMG_DEBUG_RAW=1` captures shot events in logs
- Validate notification UUID and data parsing for shot signals
- Test shot button → T0 → individual shot event sequence
- Review AMG signal parsing in `amg.py` and `amg_signals.py`

**Technical Notes**:
- AMG uses Nordic UART UUID: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
- Expected sequence: START_BTN → T0 → SHOT_RAW (multiple) → SESSION_END
- Raw hex data should be captured and parsed into discrete shot events

---

### **C. Impact Timing Correlation from Strip Chart** 📊 **CRITICAL**
**Objective**: Determine precise timing methodology for correlating BT50 impacts with shot events
**Data Analysis Required**:
- Review strip chart data from BT50 buffer samples
- Identify impact amplitude patterns and timing signatures  
- Calculate time delays between shot initiation and impact detection
- Establish correlation algorithm between AMG timing and BT50 impacts

**Strip Chart Analysis**:
```
Current Impact Detection Thresholds:
- Background noise: 1-4 amplitude
- LIGHT impacts: 10-15 amplitude  
- MEDIUM impacts: 15-40 amplitude
- HEAVY impacts: >40 amplitude
```

**Timing Requirements**:
- AMG provides T0 baseline and individual shot timing
- BT50 provides impact detection with ~2ms precision
- Need correlation algorithm to match shot → impact within reasonable time window
- Account for bullet flight time and target distance variables

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Sequential Connection Strategy**
```python
# PROVEN APPROACH - Applied to Production
async def start(self):
    # Connect AMG FIRST
    if self.cfg.amg.mac or self.cfg.amg.name:
        asyncio.create_task(_amg_loop())
        # CRITICAL DELAY - prevents Bluetooth conflicts
        await asyncio.sleep(2.0)
    
    # Connect BT50 SECOND  
    for sensor in self.cfg.sensors:
        task = asyncio.create_task(self._bt50_loop(...))
```

### **Process Conflict Detection**
```python
# PRE-FLIGHT CHECK - warns about competing processes
async def _check_process_conflicts(self):
    # Detects bridge.py, run_bridge, minimal_bridge, steelcity processes
    # Logs recommendations for cleanup
```

### **Impact Detection Algorithm**
```python
# AMPLITUDE-BASED DETECTION - validated and functional
peak_threshold = 10.0  # Minimum amplitude for real impacts
intensity = 'HEAVY' if amplitude >= 40.0 else \
           'MEDIUM' if amplitude >= 15.0 else 'LIGHT'
```
