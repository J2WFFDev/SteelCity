# HANDOFF DOCUMENT - September 1, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented AMG_RAW individual shot event generation to match BT50_RAW format. **MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Created Bridge Test protocol and identified critical virtual environment compatibility issue affecting AMG+BT50 integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced bridge.py - AMG Individual Shot Detection
**File**: `src/steelcity_impact_bridge/bridge.py`
**Method**: `_on_amg_raw()`

**Enhancement**: Added individual shot event generation to match BT50_RAW format:

```python
def _on_amg_raw(self, data):
    # Existing session-level logic preserved
    # ...existing code...
    
    # NEW: Individual shot event generation
    if os.getenv('AMG_DEBUG_RAW'):
        # Debug event for development
        self.logger.debug_event("Shot_raw", {"raw": data.hex()})
        
        # Production AMG_RAW event (matches BT50_RAW format)
        self.logger.log_event("AMG_RAW", {
            "device_id": "DC1A",
            "timestamp_ms": time.time() * 1000,
            "signal": "Impact", 
            "raw": data.hex()
        })
```

### 2. Created Bridge Test Protocol
**File**: `BRIDGE_TEST.md`

**Purpose**: Systematic end-to-end testing protocol for AMG timer integration:
- Bridge setup (kill processes, reset BT, start service)  
- AMG timer preparation (connection verification)
- Shooting test (start button ‚Üí shots ‚Üí session end)
- Results verification (tabular format extraction)

## üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Virtual Environment Compatibility Issue

### **Problem Identified**
The system has a **critical virtual environment compatibility issue** that affects combined AMG+BT50 operation:

- **AMG Timer**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly OUTSIDE venv | ‚ùå Fails INSIDE venv  
- **BT50 Sensor**: ‚ùì Status unknown - needs testing  
- **Error Pattern**: "Operation already in progress" when using venv  

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Virtual environment appears to be missing system-level Bluetooth dependencies or has conflicting package versions that prevent proper BLE operation.

### **Working Solution (Current)**
**Bridge Test successful using NO venv**:
```bash
# This works ‚úÖ
cd ~/projects/steelcity && AMG_DEBUG_RAW=1 scripts/run_bridge.sh

# This fails ‚ùå  
cd ~/projects/steelcity && source .venv/bin/activate && AMG_DEBUG_RAW=1 scripts/run_bridge.sh
```

### **Impact on Integration**
This discovery is critical for combined AMG+BT50 event correlation since:
1. Testing Protocol assumes venv operation
2. Combined system may require both devices working in same environment
3. Log event merging needs consistent environment

## Usage

### Enable Individual Shot Detection (Current Working Method)
```bash
# Without venv activation (proven working)
AMG_DEBUG_RAW=1 scripts/run_bridge.sh
```

### Expected Event Flow (Verified Working)
1. `Timer_connected` - AMG timer connects (device_id: DC1A)
2. `Timer_START_BTN` - Start button pressed  
3. `Timer_T0` - Timing baseline established
4. `SHOT_RAW` - Individual shot events (NEW FEATURE - WORKING)
5. `Timer_SESSION_END` - Session completed

## Technical Notes

- **Environment Variable**: `AMG_DEBUG_RAW=1` enables individual shot detection
- **Device ID**: AMG timer events use device_id "DC1A" (from MAC 60:09:C3:1F:DC:1A)
- **Event Format**: AMG_RAW events match BT50_RAW structure for consistency
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing session-level events preserved
- **Debug Mode**: Generates both Shot_raw (debug) and AMG_RAW (production) events
- **Environment**: **Currently works reliably outside venv only**

## Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: AMG individual shot detection implemented and verified working  
‚úÖ **TESTED**: Bridge Test confirms proper event generation (6 shots captured)  
‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**: Code ready for deployment (outside venv)  
üö® **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Virtual environment compatibility needs resolution for full integration  

## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### **1. Resolve Virtual Environment Issue**
**Options to investigate**:
- **Option A (Preferred)**: Fix venv Bluetooth dependencies  
  - Compare system vs venv packages (`pip list | grep -i blue`)
  - Install missing packages: `dbus-python`, `bluepy`, `pybluez`
  - Test both AMG and BT50 in fixed venv

- **Option B (Immediate)**: Verify system-level operation  
  - Test if BT50 works outside venv  
  - If yes, run combined AMG+BT50 without venv
  - Capture correlation events for analysis

- **Option C (Workaround)**: Hybrid logging approach  
  - AMG bridge outside venv + BT50 bridge inside venv  
  - Merge logs by timestamp for event correlation

### **2. Combined System Testing**
Once environment issue resolved:
- Run full AMG+BT50 Bridge Test  
- Capture timing correlation between systems
- Validate combined event logging format

### **3. Documentation Updates**
- Update TESTING_PROTOCOL.md with venv findings
- Create troubleshooting guide for environment issues
- Document confirmed working procedures

## Next Steps
- **Priority**: Resolve venv compatibility issue tomorrow morning
- **Goal**: Enable reliable combined AMG+BT50 event capture
- **Test**: Verify timing correlation between AMG shots and BT50 impacts
